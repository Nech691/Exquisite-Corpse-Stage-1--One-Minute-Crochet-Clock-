## Briefs for each stage

### 游댮 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 游리 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 游릭 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 游댯 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 游릮 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

*For my stage I brief, I have settled on a crocheted clock, with 120 pictures (4 per second) of it while it is being made (in this case unmade - as that is easier to photograph), displaying the numbers (from 1 to 12) moving with the rows before settling in their place. Then, the clock images will rewind and reset so that my project takes 1 minute to complete its loop. Alongside, a numerical counter will also count the seconds from 0 to indicate seconds elapsed from being of sketch*

*Initially, I set out to define 120 variables, load 120 individual images, and push each into an empty array. However, halfway through, I realised there must be a better way, and ChatGPT explained how I could use a for loop to push all images at once instead of individually*
*Next, I created two if/else loops to go through my images in order, showing 4 images per second until the 120th image, then displaying the images in descending order. I also added a function to get the milliseconds to be displayed as seconds [I did not use the seconds because then it resets at 60], and a function for each text element, as I wanted them to be in different sizes*
*ChatGPT helped me create mt descending loop and helped correct my final poem [as I my old English is not at all up to date]*
